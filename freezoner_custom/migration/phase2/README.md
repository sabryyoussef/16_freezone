# Phase 2: Related Models Migration

## Overview
This phase focuses on migrating models that have relationships with the basic models migrated in Phase 1. These models form the core business logic of the module and need to be migrated with careful consideration of their relationships and dependencies.

## Models to Migrate

### 1. Partner and Product Models
**Files to Migrate**:
- `partner.py` (12KB, 252 lines)
- `product.py` (1.8KB, 43 lines)

**Migration Tasks**:
- Update partner model with enhanced fields and relationships
- Implement new partner features from Odoo 18
- Update product model with new attributes
- Enhance partner-product relationships
- Implement new security features
- Update partner and product workflows

### 2. Document Management
**Files to Migrate**:
- `document.py` (15KB, 315 lines)
- `documents.py` (7.2KB, 162 lines)

**Migration Tasks**:
- Update document storage and access methods
- Implement new document management features
- Enhance document security
- Update document workflows
- Implement new document sharing features
- Update document versioning system

### 3. Project Management
**Files to Migrate**:
- `project.py` (69KB, 1364 lines)
- `project_fields.py` (6.5KB, 146 lines)

**Migration Tasks**:
- Update project tracking and management
- Implement new project features
- Enhance project-task relationships
- Update project security
- Implement new project reporting
- Update project workflows

## Technical Implementation Steps

### For Each Model:
1. **Model Definition Update**
   ```python
   # Odoo 18 Model Definition Template
   from odoo import models, fields, api, _
   from odoo.exceptions import UserError, ValidationError
   
   class ModelName(models.Model):
       _name = 'model.name'
       _description = 'Model Description'
       _inherit = ['mail.thread', 'mail.activity.mixin']  # If applicable
       
       # Fields will be updated here
   ```

2. **Field Updates**
   - Update field definitions to Odoo 18 standards
   - Implement new field types
   - Update computed fields
   - Add new relationship fields
   - Update field attributes and constraints

3. **Method Updates**
   - Update compute methods
   - Implement new API methods
   - Update business logic
   - Add new features
   - Update workflow methods

4. **Security Updates**
   - Update access rights
   - Implement new security rules
   - Update user groups
   - Add new security features

5. **Relationship Updates**
   - Review and update many2one relationships
   - Update many2many relationships
   - Implement new relationship features
   - Update domain filters

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 migrated models
- Odoo 18.0
- Python 3.10+
- Required Odoo modules:
  - base
  - mail
  - project
  - documents
  - sale
  - purchase
  - account

## Migration Order
1. Partner Model (foundation for relationships)
2. Product Model (depends on partner)
3. Document Models (used by both partner and product)
4. Project Models (depends on all above)

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Test model creation
- Test field computations
- Test business logic
- Test constraints
- Test relationships

### Integration Tests
- Test model relationships
- Test workflow processes
- Test data integrity
- Test security rules
- Test user access

### Performance Tests
- Test large dataset handling
- Test relationship queries
- Test compute methods
- Test security rules

## Migration Checklist

### For Each Model:
- [ ] Review current model structure
- [ ] Update model definition
- [ ] Update field definitions
- [ ] Update methods
- [ ] Update security
- [ ] Update relationships
- [ ] Write/update tests
- [ ] Document changes
- [ ] Test migration
- [ ] Verify functionality
- [ ] Test performance
- [ ] Verify security

## Notes
- Keep original models in place until migration is complete
- Document all changes for rollback purposes
- Test each model independently
- Test relationships thoroughly
- Update documentation as changes are made
- Consider performance implications
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## Next Steps
After completing Phase 2:
1. Review all migrated models
2. Run comprehensive tests
3. Document any issues
4. Proceed to Phase 3

## Support
For issues during Phase 2 migration:
1. Check Odoo 18 documentation
2. Review migration logs
3. Contact development team
4. Refer to main migration guide
