# Freezoner Module Migration Guide (Odoo 16 to Odoo 18)

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step process for migrating the Freezoner module from Odoo 16 to Odoo 18. The migration will focus on updating models, fields, and their relationships while maintaining business logic and functionality.

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Model Structure
1. **Core Models Migration**
   - Start with basic models that have minimal dependencies
   - Update model definitions to Odoo 18 standards
   - Implement new field types and attributes
   - Models to migrate in order:
     1. `exception.py` (Basic exception handling)
     2. `move.py` (Basic move operations)
     3. `rating.py` (Rating system)
     4. `document_request.py` (Document request handling)

### Phase 2: Related Models
2. **Partner and Product Models**
   - Migrate `partner.py` with updated field definitions
   - Update `product.py` with new product attributes
   - Implement new partner and product relationships

3. **Document Management**
   - Migrate `document.py` and `documents.py`
   - Update document storage and access methods
   - Implement new document management features

4. **Project Management**
   - Migrate `project.py` and `project_fields.py`
   - Update project tracking and management features
   - Implement new project-related functionalities

### Phase 3: Complex Models and Relationships
5. **Task and Sale Management**
   - Migrate `task.py` with updated task management
   - Update `sale.py` with new sale order features
   - Implement new task-sale relationships

6. **SOV and Additional Features**
   - Migrate `sov.py` (Statement of Values)
   - Update all many-to-many relationships
   - Implement new reporting features

### Phase 4: Function Updates
7. **Method and Function Updates**
   - Update all model methods to Odoo 18 standards
   - Implement new API methods
   - Update compute methods and constraints
   - Migrate business logic functions

## Technical Considerations

### Field Updates
- Replace deprecated field types
- Update field attributes to new Odoo 18 standards
- Implement new field widgets where applicable
- Update computed fields and their dependencies

### Relationship Updates
- Review and update all many2one relationships
- Update many2many relationship definitions
- Implement new relationship features
- Update domain filters and constraints

### Security Updates
- Update access rights and record rules
- Implement new security features
- Update user groups and permissions

### API Updates
- Update XML-RPC calls to new API standards
- Implement new API endpoints
- Update external integrations

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit testing for each migrated model
2. Integration testing for model relationships
3. Functionality testing for business logic
4. Performance testing for complex operations
5. Security testing for access rights

## Rollback Plan
1. Maintain backup of Odoo 16 code
2. Document all changes for easy rollback
3. Create database backup before migration
4. Test rollback procedures

## Notes
- All model names should follow Odoo 18 naming conventions
- Use new Odoo 18 features where applicable
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document all breaking changes
- Update all dependencies to Odoo 18 compatible versions

## Timeline
1. Phase 1: Basic Models (Week 1)
2. Phase 2: Related Models (Week 2)
3. Phase 3: Complex Models (Week 3)
4. Phase 4: Function Updates (Week 4)
5. Testing and Validation (Week 5)

## Dependencies
- Odoo 18.0
- Python 3.10+
- Updated external libraries
- Compatible database version

## Support
For any issues during migration:
1. Check Odoo 18 documentation
2. Review migration logs
3. Contact development team
4. Refer to Odoo upgrade guides
